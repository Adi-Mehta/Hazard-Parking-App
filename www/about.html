                <p>About Hazard</p>
                <p>Hazard was built in the college town of Eugene, Oregon. In this busy college students are forced to leave their cars parked on residintial neighborhood streets due to a lack of secure parking garages. The only issue is often times vehicles end up vandalized the next morning, when they wake up.</p>
